# Polished Crystal to pokecrystal16 migration status

## Latest checkpoint: temporary-record identity boundary (2026-09-20)

- Continues the player battle-reader checkpoint from PR #1 (`c7079f1`).
- `CopyPkmnToTempMon`, `GetPkmnSpecies`, and `GetPkmnForm` now distinguish
  persistent player/daycare records from legacy opponent/link records.
- Player transient decoding preserves gender/Egg bits in the temporary form
  byte instead of overwriting them with the masked identity form.
- The source-type guard resides with the format helpers to fit the loader's
  nearly full ROM bank. Persistent-format activation is still disabled.
- Normal and clean debug builds pass with RGBDS 1.0.3; free space is 19,534
  bytes normal and 19,420 bytes debug. No new build warnings remain.
- Both ROMs pass 576 full temporary-record copy cases and all 432 existing
  battle-boundary cases under PyBoy 2.7.0: **1,008 cases per configuration**.
  Coverage includes absent/partial/valid markers, both party types, six slots,
  extended and variant identities, metadata, source preservation, and bank/
  stack preservation. These isolated CPU tests are not gameplay validation.

## Previous checkpoint: player battle readers (2026-09-20)

- Continued from repository `master` at `e47d19bd1e94fdfc4e85e6f252ae5c2757836c28`.
- The archived overworld/special-event reader slice is now imported source;
  its previously pending debug build has passed.
- Player battle entry now decodes persistent party identity before populating
  legacy battle species/form globals. Opponent parties remain explicitly legacy.
- The player HUD and experience-growth lookup now decode player party identity.
- Clean normal and debug builds passed with RGBDS 1.0.3. Reported ROM free
  space: 19,557 bytes normal; 19,443 bytes debug.
- Isolated PyBoy 2.7.0 CPU tests passed: 144 decoder cases on the normal ROM;
  144 decoder plus 288 send-in cases on the debug ROM. Tests cover both storage
  formats, all six slots, native ID 256, Alolan Raichu, metadata preservation,
  untouched source records, and legacy opponent battle entry.
- These are routine-level tests, not gameplay, save-upgrade, or species-above-
  `$01ff` end-to-end validation. The persistent-format marker remains disabled.

The snapshot sections below describe the original archive, including its
historical uncommitted state; use this checkpoint and the next-step section for
current progress.

## Snapshot identity

- Branch: `migration/16bit-species`
- Polished Crystal baseline: `f22d31a52cbbf1387d27ba63f5bf2fa959955d37`
- pokecrystal16 reference baseline: `e9701dce610e3b421356206992f93ed604085cd8`
- Required RGBDS version: 1.0.3
- Last completed commit: `3d08aaacc Make Battle Tower party boundaries format-aware`
- Export state: includes the uncommitted overworld/special-event reader work
  described below, plus this status file and the README build section.

This is a source snapshot of an unfinished migration. The 16-bit species system
must not yet be treated as complete or enabled for persistent Pokémon records.

## Already migrated

- The pokecrystal16 table macros, indirection routines, home-bank helpers, WRAM
  conversion table, locking, garbage collection, and SRAM persistence have
  been adapted to Polished Crystal.
- Mechanically distinct variants have canonical native 16-bit species IDs.
  Cosmetic and runtime forms remain in the separate form byte.
- Native/legacy/transient identity domains have explicit conversion helpers.
- Native lookup layers cover base stats, names, evolution and level-up data,
  egg moves, palettes, footprints, sprites, animations, picture sizes, icons,
  overworld palettes, cries, Pokédex entries, and body data.
- Trainer parties, scripted encounters, wild tables, special encounters,
  gifts, NPC trades, classification lists, hidden grottos, Odd Eggs, Battle
  Tower sets, and Pokédex ordering store native 16-bit IDs in ROM where their
  readers have already been adapted.
- Pokédex flags, roaming Pokémon, Bug Contest winners, Hall of Fame native
  shadows, conversion-table primary/backup save data, and related native-ID
  persistence infrastructure are present.
- Dual-format party/daycare structure helpers support legacy records and the
  future transient-ID persistent format.
- Party loading/search/menu, evolution, insertion, breeding/daycare, egg
  lifecycle, maintenance, graphical readers, Hall of Fame serialization, Gen 2
  link serialization/trade UI, and Battle Tower player-party boundaries have
  been made format-aware.
- The latest completed step, commit `3d08aaacc`, converts player records crossing
  Battle Tower work areas while retaining their established legacy layouts.

[`docs/16_bit_species_migration.md`](docs/16_bit_species_migration.md).

## Partially migrated in this snapshot

The working tree contains an unfinished overworld and special-event reader
slice after `3d08aaacc`. It updates identity reads used by:

- the Ho-Oh chamber party check;
- Professor Elm's evolution phone calls;
- script-selected Poképics;
- Wonder Trade's Spiky-eared Pichu restriction;
- outgoing NPC-trade metadata;
- the Judge Machine party switch;
- poison-step ability checks; and
- the general script helper that derives the current party species.

These edits are deliberately uncommitted. A clean normal build passed. The
final clean debug build and commit review were not completed before export.
Representation-independent reads such as Egg flags and structure offsets remain
direct byte reads by design.

## Not yet migrated or activated

- The persistent party/daycare format marker remains unset. Existing party and
  daycare records therefore continue using the legacy species/form encoding.
- Old-save party/daycare records have not yet been atomically converted to
  transient IDs.
- Opponent-party and central battle-engine consumers still require a complete
  audit before trainer and wild ingestion can safely allocate transient IDs.
- Ordinary wild catches and opponent-party construction remain legacy at their
  persistent/runtime boundary.
- Remaining raw party/opponent/battle species reads must be classified and
  converted according to whether their input is persistent, transient, or
  legacy ROM data.
- Newbox has not yet been converted to native 16-bit stored identities or added
  to conversion-table garbage collection.
- Full save/load, catch, evolution, breeding, PC, trade, Battle Tower, link,
  Hall of Fame, Pokédex, and battle regression testing has not been completed.
- No end-to-end proof species above `$01ff` has been added or tested.
- 16-bit move IDs and item IDs are outside the current species milestone and
  have not been migrated.

## Known build state and temporary workarounds

- The last committed checkpoint passed clean normal and debug builds with RGBDS
  1.0.3.
- The included uncommitted reader slice passed a clean normal build. Its clean
  debug build had not been run when this archive was created.
- No known source-level linker or assembler error is present in the normal
  configuration.
- RGBDS 1.0.3 was kept outside the repository during development and invoked by
  prepending its directory to `PATH`. It is not bundled in this archive.
- A monochrome build must be started after `make tidy`; reusing normal-mode
  generated objects can trigger palette-size assertions unrelated to the
  migration source.
- ROM0 space was reclaimed by moving `HandleStoneTableAction` beside its sole
  caller. This allows the 16-bit home routines to link without trampolines.
- The conversion table occupies WRAM bank 2 at `$d500-$d5ff`; its save copies
  use previously unused SRAM padding so existing checksum and Newbox addresses
  do not move.

## Next recommended step

Continue the battle/party boundary audit: remaining ability/AI and item readers,
opponent-party construction, wild catches, and battle-to-party write-back.
The central player send-in, player HUD, and experience-growth reads are now
format-aware; this does not authorize switching opponent records to transient
IDs. The shared temporary-record loader now distinguishes legacy opponent sources.
Audit garbage-collection roots against the chosen opponent/battle representation
before enabling allocation there; then convert catch insertion at its completed
player-record boundary.
Do not activate the persistent-format marker until downstream consumers and
atomic old-save conversion are ready. Newbox remains a separate unfinished
native-identity boundary.

## Build commands

Install RGBDS 1.0.3 and the dependencies documented in `INSTALL.md`. With RGBDS
on `PATH`:

```sh
make tidy
make -j2
```

For the debug configuration:

```sh
make tidy
make -j2 debug
```

The generated `.gbc`, `.map`, `.sym`, object files, and compiled assets are
build products and are not included in the export. The project can regenerate
them from the included source and tool code.

## Focused battle identity regression test

After building, install the optional emulator test dependency and run:

```sh
python -m pip install pyboy==2.7.0
python tests/test_battle_party_identity.py polishedcrystal-3.2.3.gbc
python tests/test_tempmon_identity.py polishedcrystal-3.2.3.gbc
# Or, after the debug build:
python tests/test_battle_party_identity.py polishedcrystal-debug-3.2.3.gbc
python tests/test_tempmon_identity.py polishedcrystal-debug-3.2.3.gbc
```

The test uses the matching `.sym` file and executes compiled assembly directly.
It seeds a conversion-table entry whose slot differs from its species identity,
checks player decoding and unchanged opponent interpretation, and stops the
send-in path before base-data loading. It does not load or write a game save.
